Let us assume that you work for Nike. As a general manager you are responsible for managing the warehouses, and more importantly, 
perform stock taking. To optimise your delivery time and for improved organisation, you have decided to use your Python knowledge to get 
an overview of what each stock-taking session entails.

Nike warehouses store the following information: 

●Country 
●Code 
●Product 
●Cost 
●Quantity  

You would like to be able to use your program to do the following: 

●Search products by code. 
●Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it. 
●Determine the product with the highest quantity and offer a discount for that model. 
●Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by multiplying the cost by the quantity for each item entered 
into the system.
●Add new products.
●View all products in stock.
